I found this activity very helpful. I love the "10 exercises for Software Engineers"
I worry about getting headaches from looking at my screen too long because I am prone to headaches. 

I've struggled for years with neck pain ever since I fell snow skiing and a I ran into an open car door while riding my bike. My C1 and C2 disc are degenerative so my neck gets very irritated if I am not careful. I also have a broken right wrist with arthritis. 

Before I started Techtonica, I bought a stand up desk and a big monitor. I think I need a web cam as my laptop with the camera is off to the side and I am turning my neck too much. 

I am going to try and exercise everyday at lunch. My favorite fitness apps are Burn SF with Lisa Corsello and Carve It fitness which is rebounding app. 

I learned the hard way how fast your body can go downhill when you sit all day. When I started this journey, I didn't exercise like I used to and I sat on the couch all day with my laptop on my lap! My back was so tight and I gained a ton of weight. I also became really depressesed and had headaches all of the time. I started exercising and many of my symtopms slowly went away. :)

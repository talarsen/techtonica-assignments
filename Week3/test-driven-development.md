What is test driven development?
Answer: Write a test for the code by psuedocoding all of the test and edge cases you can think of before
you start to code. 

What is an edge case?
An edge case is when an unsual input that the code should account for. 
Edge cases are anything weird and the literal edge of what your specified conditions. 

An example is entering a number when a string is expected. 
or the string expected in not the string you wanted. 

What is scope? 
There is local and global scope. 
Functions are defined in the local scope. 
Variables defined within a function are local scope. 
Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.
The child function is lexically bound by that of the parent function.

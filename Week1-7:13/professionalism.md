In my past career as a teacher, I've worked with very professional and very non professional teachers. I've seen the long term consequences of what happens to people who are not professional. There is a loss of respect and huge communication break down with the non professional person. Also, working with a non professional breaks down the morale of the team or other co-workers who work with the non professional. It is a real bummer and can be very frustrating! 

I tend to avoid speaking up and confrontation at ALL cost.  I found the Dealing with Difficult People video very helpful because it gave specific things to say to deal with difficult situations.

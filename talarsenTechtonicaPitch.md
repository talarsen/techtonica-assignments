Hello, my name is Tara Larsen. My pronouns are she/her. I’m interested in tech because there are diverse opportunities, there’s limited stagnation and it has the potential to make a positive impact on society. I am excited to join Techtonica because I want to be part of a program that recognizes the power of diversity and inclusion. Techtonica provides all the things I need to succeed. I learn best through discovery and collaboration and I am super excited to have a mentor because lack of mentorship has been my biggest barrier to becoming a software engineer. I believe I’ll make a good software engineer because I am motivated by the challenges that coding presents and that motivation increases my commitment, curiosity and creativity in software engineering. I would love to build accessible software that gives back to areas related to education, healthcare, the environment and wildland management.
